        In the realm of digital tools, utility-driven applications play a vital role in simplifying mathematical and geometrical computations. This project presents the development of a Shape Calculator application designed to compute the area and perimeter of multiple geometric shapes with precision and ease.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built using the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), the application emphasizes reusability, scalability, and modularity through the use of inheritance, method overloading, and well-structured class hierarchies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Shape Calculator features a user-friendly interface that allows users to select a desired shape—such as a rectangle, circle, triangle, or square—and input the corresponding dimensions. Upon processing the input, the application performs the necessary calculations and displays the results instantly. Future enhancements could include support for more complex shapes and even 3D geometry.

        Today’s software environment demands modular and reusable code, especially for utility-based tools. This project is centered on creating a Shape Calculator application using Object-Oriented Programming principles, focusing on inheritance and method overloading. It demonstrates how systematic approaches to computing geometric properties (area and perimeter) can address real-world problems effectively.

        Conventional calculators often struggle with diverse geometric computations, particularly when new shapes or formulas need to be added. The Shape Calculator addresses these challenges by integrating OOP features such as inheritance, polymorphism, and method overloading. Each geometric shape is encapsulated in its own class with specific methods for computing area and perimeter, which not only promotes code reuse but also ensures scalability.
